<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: July 2, 2025</p>

<p>Beast CV ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS application ("App") and related backend services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resume Content (TXT or PDF)</strong> – When you choose to improve your resume, the App uploads your file to our backend. The file is processed in‑memory and <em>is not stored</em> on our servers after processing.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymous User ID</strong> – The App generates a unique, random identifier tied to your device. We store this ID to manage subscriptions, quotas, and billing. It contains no personal details.</li>
<li><strong>Device &amp; Usage Data</strong> (optional) – Apple may provide us with anonymized crash and analytics data if you have opted‑in to share such data in iOS settings. We do not attempt to identify you from this information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To transmit your resume to OpenAI’s API for text improvement.</li>
<li>To deliver the improved resume back to your device.</li>
<li>To verify active subscriptions and free‑tier limits using your anonymous User ID.</li>
<li>To monitor and enhance the stability, security, and performance of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third‑Party Processing</h2>
<p>We rely on <a href='https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>OpenAI, L.L.C.</a> to transform resume content. Your resume data is transmitted to OpenAI’s servers <em>only</em> for the duration of processing and is <em>not retained</em> by us. OpenAI’s handling of data is governed by its own privacy policy, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review it.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Resume files and the improved text are automatically deleted from our backend within minutes of completion of processing.</li>
<li>Your anonymous User ID is stored for as long as your account or subscription remains active. You may request deletion at any time (see Section 9).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We secure all network traffic with TLS (HTTPS). Access to backend systems is restricted and monitored. Although we employ commercially reasonable safeguards, no internet transmission or storage system is guaranteed to be 100&nbsp;% secure.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access &amp; Deletion.</strong> You may request a copy of the data we hold about you (limited to your anonymous User ID) or ask us to delete it.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Opt‑Out.</strong> You can disable iOS “Share analytics with app developers” in your device settings to stop Apple from sending anonymized analytics to us.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new version within the App and at the URL where this policy is hosted. Continued use of the Service after changes are effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

<h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at <a href='mailto:beastcv2025@gmail.com'>beastcv2025@gmail.com</a>.</p>
